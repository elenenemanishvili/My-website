<p>Color (American English) or colour (British English)
     is the visual perceptual property deriving from the spectrum of light interacting
      with the photoreceptor cells of the eyes. Color categories and physical
       specifications of color are associated with objects or materials based on their 
       physical properties such as light absorption, reflection, or emission spectra. 
       By defining a color space, colors can be identified numerically by their coordinates.

    Because perception of color stems from the varying spectral sensitivity of different types of cone cells in the retina to different parts of the spectrum, colors may be defined and quantified by the degree to which they stimulate these cells. These physical or physiological quantifications of color, however, do not fully explain the psychophysical perception of color
     appearance.</p>
    <p class="larger-text">Most light sources emit light at many different wavelengths;
         a source's spectrum is a distribution giving its intensity at each wavelength. Although the spectrum of light arriving at the eye from a given direction determines the color sensation in that direction, there are many more possible spectral combinations than color sensations. In fact, one may formally define a color as a class of spectra that give rise to the same color sensation, although such classes would vary widely among different species, and to a lesser extent among individuals within the same species. In each such class, the members are called metamers of the color in question. This effect can be visualized
         by comparing the light sources' spectral power
          distributions and the resulting colors.</p>
        <p class="larger-text">The familiar colors of the rainbow in the spectrum—named using the Latin word for appearance or apparition by Isaac Newton in 1671—include all those colors that can be produced by visible light of a single wavelength only, the pure spectral or monochromatic colors. The table at right shows approximate frequencies (in terahertz) and wavelengths (in nanometers) for spectral colors in the visible range. Spectral colors have 100% purity, and are fully saturated. A complex mixture of spectral colors can be used to describe any color, which is the definition of
             a light power spectrum.</p></section>
